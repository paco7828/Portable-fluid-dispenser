Portable-fluid-dispenser
1. Place the plastic pipe into the desired fluid input tank (eg. bottle)
2. Place the output tank (eg. cup) under the fluid output
3. Plug in the device (USB-C 5V)
4. When the button is pressed the water will be moved from the input
to the output.

Extra improvement:
  -bottle should be placed under the device (straw goes inside the bottle)
  -ability to carry the device
  -place the device on your desk with the bottle connected, press a button, and get the fluid out next to the bottle into the cup
